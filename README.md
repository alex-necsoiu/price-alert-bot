# Price Oscilation Bot

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Connect to Uphold public ticker and retrieve the Currency Pair rate every 5 seconds. Each time you retrieve a new rate, the bot must compare it with the first one and decide if it should alert of an oscillation. For the purpose of this exercise we want to be alerted if the price changes 0.01 percent in either direction (price goes up or down).
